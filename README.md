# QARAC
Question Answering, Reasoning and Consistency

This is a research project to investigate ways of making NLP models more factually accurate.

A description of the project can be found at [QARAC: Question Answering, Reasoning and Consistency](https://playfultechnology.co.uk/qarac-question-answering-reasoning-and-consistency.html)  and updates can be found at the [project diary](https://playfultechnology.co.uk/tag/qarac.html). 

Models will be available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/PlayfulTechnology) and will be based on [Hyena models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866).
